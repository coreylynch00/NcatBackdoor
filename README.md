# NetcatBackdoor
This PowerShell proof‑of‑concept automates the deployment of Nmap on a Windows host and sets up an `ncat` listener using the first available port, starting from port **87**. It is intended for controlled red‑team, lab, and research scenarios where demonstrating post‑exploitation tooling setup is required.
